# Save and Read Data from a Mysql Database,Databases Course

This is one of the  small class projects:

I provide you with the  source code of a basic application using PHP,
with this source code you're able to connect to the database for the exercise given in class, the following actions are tested :

- Write new records filling the forms. 
- Query records from the database and visualize it.
- A basic html5 usage.

For security reasons you can see a live version in : 
www.hectorfjimenez.us/x/dbcourse/ej1, keep in mind that this will be *available until **April 22** of 2017*,  if you want to see this small application after the previous date just follow the installation procedure below. 


### Installation

To run this small project you will need a LAMP stack, I test this in a debian 9, and Ubuntu Zesty.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the game.

```sh
~ MySQLExercises/App$ sudo ./install.sh
```
This version is not tested for Windows enviroments, but it should work!,you will need to install the files manually, and set up the database
